# Oregon Trail Re-Write
This is a terminal ran version of the Oregon Trail video game. This was my final project for CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder. The code was written in C++ and the provided file is a Unix Executable File compiled from that code. You should be able to try it out on Linux or Mac operating systems.

## Try it out
```
git clone https://github.com/prestonwindfeldt/Oregon-Trail-re-write.git
cd Oregon-Trail-re-write
./OregonTrailRe-Write
```
